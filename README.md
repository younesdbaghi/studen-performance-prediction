Student Performance Prediction 🎓📊

This is a simple machine learning project using classifiers for predicting factors that affect student grades, using data from a CSV file. 📈

In this project, a dataset with students from different nationalities 🌍, various grade levels 📚, and determining factors such as the number of hands raised ✋, number of attendances 📝, and number of hours studied ⏰ is used, which is a CSV file.

Several different classifiers and ML models 🤖 have been used to get the most accurate predictions of which factors affect the marks of students.

A few visual aids, like graphs 📊 and the confusion matrix 🔄, have been created to show the results.
